                <h2>WA-LCH Game Discription</h2>
                <p>In this game, you play as a laboratory cleaning help robot from the company "World Acess" 
                    (from which the name of the name World Acess - Laboratory Cleaning Help comes).<br></br>
                    Your objective is to clean out radioactive waste and turn on the power generators. 
                    Around the level you will find two different types of enemies, 
                    you will find one which will always try and move toward you but stay at a certain distance and shoot you. 
                    And the second one walks around randomly until you start cleaning or turning on a power generator. 
                    You clean waste with cleaning pods which you find around the level. These pods can store four wastes each, 
                    and for every four wastes cleaned your keycard access level goes up so you can explore more of the level.<br></br>
                    Around the laboratory, you will also find pickups to restore HP and ammo. And you can find a robot helper, 
                    which you can turn on and it will follow you around, dropping pickups when you are low on HP or ammo. 
                    This helper will come with you to the next level but you will lose it when you die or leave the game.<br></br>
                    The levels and spawns are all randomly generated so no playthrough will be the same. Every time you clear a level the next one gets bigger, 
                    which also makes it harder to clean and more dangerous because more enemies spawn.<br></br>
                    I made this project together with two artists and two developers, they are all listed in the credits of the game<br></br>
                    This game is made using Unity, C# and Blender. It was released in June 2024 and took 4 weeks to make.
