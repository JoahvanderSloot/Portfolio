            <p>I have a lot of experience with the Unity game engine. I made almost all my game projects in Unity (view
                my itch page to play them).<br>
                I can make gameplay and systems. I have a lot of experience with UI and menus, but this is not where my
                passion lies. I just made a lot of menus, so I got experienced with doing them.<br>
                I know Unity 2D and 3D; I prefer 3D, but my skill level is similar in both. I always stay up to date
                with the newest versions of Unity, and I learn new systems or features quickly if necessary for a
                project.

            <img src="assets/images/CSharpicon.png" alt="C# Image">
            <p>My main programming language is C#, because I make my games with Unity, which uses C#.<br>
                I am still developing my knowledge since there is a lot to know, but if I don't know about something, I
                often quickly find it and implement it.<br>
                My C# skills are developed enough to make games and some more difficult systems. I code in Visual Studio
                Code or Visual Studio 2022, depending on the type of project.

            <p>Next to games, I also have some web development skills.<br>
                For example, this portfolio website I made myself. I don't have a lot of other work to show since I don't enjoy web development as much as games, 
                so I end up not finishing most projects with websites, but I do know how to code with HTML and make web pages.

            <img src="assets/images/CSS.png" alt="CSS Image">
            <p>Just like with HTML, I am also familiar with CSS.<br>
                I am not a front-end developer at heart because I am not experienced with visual designs for websites. But I know how to make a design someone gives me, 
                and I can do some of my own designing, like this portfolio.<br>
                I prefer to use a loose style.css file instead of inline styling within HTML, but I can do both depending on what's needed and how big the web project is.

            <p>When I started learning how to code, the first language I ever used was p5js.<br>
                And I used this for half a year before switching to doing game development in Unity. 
                But I still know how to code in p5js.<br>
                A lot of this knowledge carries over to being able to code JavaScript. 
                I can make simple projects or small features in a website with JavaScript. And I don't think I will ever forget p5js, 
                since that's where I started out when I knew basically nothing.

            <p>In my time I spent making games. I had a lot of team projects, or projects that I needed to work on via different devices.<br>
                I have been using Git for this since I started programming. I am very used to keeping my GitHub repositories up to date. 
                I personally use GitHub Desktop for this, but I could work with different applications too.

            <p>During my time spent learning web development, I also ended up using PHP for some backend stuff, and when I worked with databases, I used PHP.<br>
                I am not the best at this since I really did not like coding in the language. 
                You code a lot within quotes, so it does not tell you when you make a typo, which messes me up quite often.

            <p>A lot of my projects are team projects, and I have done a lot of teamwork-related activities and/or projects in my life. 
                Working together with people in a team is not hard for me. I can easily switch roles, and if I feel comfortable within a group, working together almost happens automatically.<br>
                I am used to SCRUM while making games in a team. I also participated in multiple game jams, 
                which were a good way to further develop my teamwork skills, and I was part of a student exchange program with a school in Finland, so I even worked with international teammates.
                <br></br>
               I also have international teamwork experience. I participated in a student exchange program between my school in the Netherlands and a school from Finland. 
               In the exchange, I was teamed with one Dutch artist, one Finnish developer, and two other Finnish artists.<br>
                I and my fellow Dutch students were at their school for 2 weeks. Then we had a 2-week phase where we worked together online, 
                and then the students from Finland came to Holland for a week, and we finished the project off together.<br>
