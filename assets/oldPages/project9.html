                <h2>Animal Memory Discription</h2>
                <p>I think most people know how memory works, but just to be sure I will quickly explain the rules. 
                    You have a grid of cards with identical images on the back, every turn you get to flip over two cards, 
                    the cards have different images on the front and they come in pairs, 
                    when you find a pair you get to take both cards out of the grid. Like this, 
                    you have to clear the grid by finding all the pairs. 
                    After you turn over two cards they get turned back so you have to memorize what image they had on the front side, 
                    hence the name “Memory”.<br></br>
                    If you play against a different player the goal is not to clear the grid perse but it is to get more pairs than the other player. 
                    When you find a pair you get to flip again but if you don’t find a pair it’s the other player's turn.<br></br>
                    In my version of Memory, I gave it an animal theme, so the front images are all animal species 
                    (twenty-six different species). When you find a pair this animal will pop up on your screen and tell you one or more fun facts about itself.<br></br>
                    I did fact-check these facts but almost all of them are from my knowledge of animals, which I thought was kind of cool. 
                    This is also why I chose the species I chose, I only chose species I knew fun facts about. Or animals I just know a lot about in general.<br></br>
                    This game is made using Unity and C#, and released in November 2023.
