                    <h3>Merge Packing</h3>
                    <p>Pack up your old toys by merging them into bigger objects in my first mobile game. 
                        Which I and a team of four in total made in a 4-day game jam with the theme "instantly hooked." 
                        So we tried to make it as simple and addictive as mobile games often are.

                    <h3>Grapple Battle</h3>
                    <p>I made a game where you can fight your friends as a ninja in a 3D first-person online multiplayer pvp game.
                        You have a grappling hook and fight on floating islands, swinging around and attacking each other with a katana and shurikens.

                    <h3>WA-LCH origins</h3>
                    <p>A prequel to the original WA-LCH game, 
                        where you play as a cleaning robot in the same laboratory as in the original. 
                        Except now, it is still in use by the scientists, but they are very clumsy, 
                        and you have to keep the lab clean.

                    <h3>Color Dodge</h3>
                    <p>I made a really simple infinite game where you dodge and catch circles depending on their color. 
                        I created this game as a challenge to see how quickly I could recreate a game I saw on my friend's smartwatch. 
                        It only took me 6 hours to make.

                        You can have a player join with a keyboard or a controller, 
                        and you can play on 2 different maps.

                        You collect score points by killing enemies. Every five rounds, you fight a boss.
                        You can upgrade your ship with pickups that drop from killed enemies.

            <p>My skills are all still improving, I am mostly familiar with Unity and C#, since I make basically all my
                games in there and I'm mainly a game developer.
                My web development skills are less developed but I can write HTML and CSS. Also, I have some basic
                knowledge of databases and PHP.
                I also have GitHub experience as well as experience with working in a team.

                <p>Hello there!<br>
                    My name is Joah, I am a young game developer from the Netherlands.<br></br>
                    I am very passionate about creating games, and I also enjoy playing them.<br>
                    From designing simple games my friends and I used to play in elementary school, to coding video
                    games myself,
                    my journey in game development has been a long and creative one.
                    I'm an avid gamer, movie enthusiast, and book lover, which all inspire my passion for storytelling
                    and fuel my creativity.<br>
                    Outside the virtual world, I’m active in the gym and train in kickboxing.
                    I enjoy solving Rubik’s cubes, exploring nature and I love animals. I am also fascinated with the
                    samurai and ancient Japan,
                    with its rich history and culture.</p>
