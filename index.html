                <p>Hello there!<br>
                    My name is Joah, I am a young game developer from the Netherlands.<br></br>
                    I am very passionate about creating games, and I also enjoy playing them.<br>
                    From designing simple games my friends and I used to play in elementary school, to coding video games myself, 
                    my journey in game development has been a long and creative one.
                    I'm an avid gamer, movie enthusiast, and book lover, which all inspire my passion for storytelling and fuel my creativity.<br>
                    Outside the virtual world, I’m active in the gym and train in kickboxing. 
                    I enjoy solving Rubik’s cubes, exploring nature and I love animals. I am also fascinated with the samurai and ancient Japan, 
                    with its rich history and culture.</p>
