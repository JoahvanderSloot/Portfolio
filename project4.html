                <h2>Asteroids 3D Discription</h2>
                <p>In my take on the old “Asteroids” game, but with 3D assets, is gameplay-wise very similar to the original. 
                    You have a top-down view of your spaceship and you can fly around the screen shooting asteroids with break up into smaller pieces or space rubble.
                    Every time you clear all the asteroids a new round starts and new space rocks get spawned in. 
                    Every round a yellow sphere also spawns which gives you 10 coins to spend in the shop.
                    Every round you also have a chance for there to spawn a wrench which when you pick it up can be used to fix damage to your ship.<br></br>
                    Breaking asteroids gives you points that get added up to your score, also a high score is tracked.
                    In the shop mentioned earlier, you have 4 different spacecrafts. 
                    The first one is the default ship and is unlocked at the start of the game. 
                    The other 3 have to be bought with coins. These spacecrafts have different attacks which all have their unique uses.<br></br>
                    These attacks are very important because in the 10th round, an enemy ship spawns in and tries to kill you. 
                    When you defeat this ship you get points and coins.<br></br>
                    This game is made using Unity and C#, and released in February 2024.
