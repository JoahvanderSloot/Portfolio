                <h2>SteamBugs Discription</h2>
                <p>SteamBugs is a “shoot them up” game. You are a robot bird that shoots laser bullets out its beak. 
                    You fly through a steampunk factory where robot insects are being made. 
                    These insects try to stop you from flying deeper into the factory where their boss is.<br></br>
                    The boss has three different attacks, you encounter it multiple times through the game 
                    (which can technically go on forever if you are good enough). 
                    Every time the boss comes back it has an extra attack until it uses all three of them at the same time.
                    You can select a difficulty in the start menu, which affects how many enemies spawn, 
                    how fast they are, and how strong the boss is.<br></br>
                    The difficulty also affects how many points you gain from killing enemies, 
                    These points count up your score and a high score is tracked in the main menu.<br></br>
                    This project was the first team project I ever made, the teamwork was quite fluent, 
                    we had good communication and everyone did their job very well.<br></br>
                    This game is made using Unity, C# and Blender. It was released in June 2024 and took 4 weeks to make.
