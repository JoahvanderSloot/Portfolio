                    <h3>Slipstream</h3>
                    <p>A first-person parkour game where you try to collect as many checkpoints as possible in a certain
                        time with a drone chasing you trying to catch you.
                        There are 2 levels with different game times and different types of objects, but both with the
                        same objective to collect checkpoints.

                    <h3>Merge Packing</h3>
                    <p>Pack up your old toys by merging them into bigger objects in my first mobile game.
                        Which I and a team of four in total made in a 4-day game jam with the theme "instantly hooked."
                        So we tried to make it as simple and addictive as mobile games often are.

                    <h3>Grapple Battle</h3>
                    <p>I made a game where you can fight your friends as a ninja in a 3D first-person online multiplayer
                        pvp game.
                        You have a grappling hook and fight on floating islands, swinging around and attacking each
                        other with a katana and shurikens.

                    <h3>WA-LCH origins</h3>
                    <p>A prequel to the original WA-LCH game,
                        where you play as a cleaning robot in the same laboratory as in the original.
                        Except now, it is still in use by the scientists, but they are very clumsy,
                        and you have to keep the lab clean.

                    <h3>Color Dodge</h3>
                    <p>I made a really simple infinite game where you dodge and catch circles depending on their color.
                        I created this game as a challenge to see how quickly I could recreate a game I saw on my
                        friend's smartwatch.
                        It only took me 6 hours to make.

                    <h3>Ballpit Chase</h3>
                    <p>A local multiplayer parkour tag game,
                        where you can play with 2–4 players and play a classic tag game in a ball pit playhouse.
                        You can have a player join with a keyboard or a controller,
                        and you can play on 2 different maps.

                    <p>A SHMUP taking place in space where you have to fight off enemy spacecrafts.
                        You collect score points by killing enemies. Every five rounds, you fight a boss.
                        You can upgrade your ship with pickups that drop from killed enemies.

                        abandoned laboratory.
                        You have to defend yourself against aggressive robots while trying to clean out radioactive
                        waste and turn on the power generators.
